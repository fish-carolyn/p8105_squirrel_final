#### Project title

Getting to know Central Parkâ€™s Squirrels: An analysis of the demographic
and behavioral patterns of NYC squirrels

#### Motivation/ Statement of Purpose

Squirrels are familiar neighbors to all New Yorkers. Central Park
provides over 800 acres of prime habitat for approximately 2,300
squirrels (roughly 2.74 squirrels per acre)1. Given the high prevalence
of squirrels in New York City and their versatile role as friends,
pests, vectors for diseases, such as rabies, and snacks to local
predators, we aim to describe behavioral trends and spatial distribution
of squirrel sightings in Central Park using 2018 Squirrel Census data2.

#### Intended final product

A descriptive report of Central Park squirrel demography and behavior.
Results will also be shared via a GitHub hosted Webpage and a short
explanatory video.

#### Data sources

Squirrel census data is publicly available for download here: Squirrel
Census Data.

#### Analyses/ Visualizations

We anticipate our analysis of Central Park squirrels will generate: -
Squirrel demography table (fur color, age, fur highlight color) -
Descriptive table of squirrel activity and time of survey (AM/PM,
location, activity, vocalizations) - A density cluster map of Central
Park squirrel sightings (Central Park in whole, by zipcode, by community
district)
