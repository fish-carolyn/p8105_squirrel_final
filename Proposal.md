#### Project title

Getting to know Central Parkâ€™s Squirrels: An analysis of the demographic
and behavioral patterns of NYC squirrels

#### Motivation/ Statement of Purpose

Squirrels are familiar neighbors to all New Yorkers. Central Park
provides over 800 acres of prime habitat for approximately 2,300
squirrels (roughly 2.74 squirrels per acre)<sup>1</sup>. Given the high
prevalence of squirrels in New York City and their versatile role as
friends, pests, vectors for diseases, such as rabies, and snacks to
local predators, we aim to describe behavioral trends and spatial
distribution of squirrel sightings in Central Park using 2018 Squirrel
Census data<sup>2</sup>.

#### Intended final product

A descriptive report of Central Park squirrel demography and behavior,
including observed trends from our analyses. Results will also be shared
via a GitHub hosted Webpage and a short explanatory video.

#### Data sources

The 2018 Squirrel Census data is publicly available for download here:
<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw>.

#### Analyses/ Visualizations

We anticipate our analysis of Central Park squirrels will generate:

- **Table 1:** Squirrel demography table (fur color, age, fur highlight
  color)
- **Table 2:** Descriptive table of squirrel activity and time of survey
  (AM/PM, location, activity, vocalizations)
- **Figure 1:** A density cluster map of Central Park squirrel sightings
  (Central Park in whole, by zipcode, by community district)

*Additional figures will likely be derived from the descriptive tables
to better demonstrate any interesting findings that we observe in the
data.*

#### Coding challenges

We anticipate the data will require substantial cleaning and the ability
to appropriately test significance in demographic, behavioral, or
spatial distributions may be limited by small sample size. If the 2018
census sample is insufficient, we may have to bring in 2020 Squirrel
Census data. Joining of these data sets may require additional tidying
and research to ensure variables were reproducibly measured for each
survey.

#### Planned Timeline

- *09Nov23 - 17Nov23*: Proposal development
- *18Nov23 - 26Nov23*: Exploratory analysis, table construction
- *27Nov23 - 08Dec23*: Crunch Time (Write report, statistical analyses,
  final figure development)
- *09Dec23*: Project report, website, webcast, and team evals due
