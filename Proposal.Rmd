#### Project title
Getting to know Central Parkâ€™s Squirrels: An analysis of the demographic and behavioral patterns of NYC squirrels 

#### Motivation/ Statement of Purpose
Squirrels are familiar neighbors to all New Yorkers. Central Park provides over 800 acres of prime habitat for approximately 2,300 squirrels (roughly 2.74 squirrels per acre)1. Given the high prevalence of squirrels in New York City and their versatile role as friends, pests, vectors for diseases, such as rabies, and snacks to local predators, we aim to describe behavioral trends and spatial distribution of squirrel sightings in Central Park using 2018 Squirrel Census data2.
