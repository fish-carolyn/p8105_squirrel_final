alternative name: "Tales from Treetops"?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
```

First, we will import the squirrel data. 

```{r}
squirrel_census = 
  read_csv("data/squirrel.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
In this section, we will be looking at squirrel demographics, such as fur color and age. 

Lets first explore squirrel ages 
```{r}
squirrel_census |> 
  filter(!(age %in% c("N/A", "?"))) |> 
  group_by(age) |> 
  count(age) |> 
  mutate(Age = fct_reorder(age, n)) |> 
  plot_ly (x = ~age, y = ~n, color = ~age,
         type = "bar") |> 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Age"),   
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Squirrels") 
  )
```
