#### Who are the Central Park squirrels? Here we report who they are and what they look like. 


```{r}
# First, we will import the cleaned squirrel data and a shapefile of Central Park. 
squirrel_census = 
  read_csv("data/clean_squirrel_2018.csv")

central_park_map = st_read(here::here('central_park', 'CentralPark.shp'), quiet = TRUE)
```
In the 2018 census, there are `r nrow(squirrel_census)` unique squirrel sightings documented. As volunteer researchers observed the squirrels, they provided each squirrel with a unique identifier and documented the age and fur colors of each critter.

### How mature? 

#### Let's first explore squirrel ages.

 age_bar
 
 ```

The majority of observed squirrels are `adults.` There are 2503 `adult` squirrels in the data set and only 319 `juvenile` squirrels.

We can also see that `juvenile` squirrels can be frequently observed in some areas of the Central Park, such as Central Park West between 72nd St. and 66th St.

### What color? 

#### Let's also look at primary and highlight fur color.
  
Some squirrels model only one fur color, but some extra fashionable squirrels will don mixed patterns of multiple fur colors. The `primary` fur color is the main color of the squirrel and the `secondary` colors accent the `primary` color to give some squirrels unique style. 




:::: {style="display: flex;"}

::: {}

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
squirrel_census |> 
  filter(!(combination_of_primary_and_highlight_color %in% c("N/A", "?"))) |> 
  group_by(primary_fur_color) |> 
  count(primary_fur_color) |> 
  mutate(primary_fur_color = fct_reorder(primary_fur_color, n)) |> 
  plot_ly (x = ~primary_fur_color, y = ~n, color = ~primary_fur_color,
           type = "bar", colors = "viridis") |> 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Primary Fur Color"),   
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Squirrels"),
    legend = list(x = 0, y = 1, orientation = "h")
  )
```

<br><br>  

We can see that most squirrels in Central Park have `gray` fur with some `cinnamon` or `white` accents (above). Squirrels that are `black` with or without any accent colors are very rare! Consider yourself lucky if you've ever seen one of them frolicking in the park! 

If you'd like to try your luck and observe a `black` squirrel in "the wild", we'd recommend hanging around some specific spots that the `black` squirrels seem to cluster in, like the South-East corner of the park or the North Woods above 96th St, as shown on the map (right).

### Are age and color related? 

#### Is there a difference in primary fur color depending on age? 

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

::: {}

<br><br> 

Using the squirrel census data, we do not observe any difference in `primary` fur color by the `age` of the squirrel (right). Among `juveniles` and `adults`, `gray` squirrels dominate the counts!

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}

  squirrel_census |> 
  filter(age != "?") |> 
  group_by(age, primary_fur_color) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) |> 
  mutate(percent = round(count / sum(count) * 100, 1))

squirrel_fur_age |> 
  mutate(hover_text = str_c("Age: ", age, "<br>Primary Fur Color: ", primary_fur_color, "<br>Percent: ", percent, "%")) |> 
  plot_ly (x = ~age, y = ~percent, color = ~primary_fur_color,
         type = "bar", colors = "viridis", text = ~hover_text) |>

    xaxis = list(title = "Age"),
