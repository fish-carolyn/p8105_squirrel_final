#### Report

The written report produced by your team is central to this project. This will detail how you completed your project, and should cover data collection and cleaning, exploratory analyses, alternative strategies, descriptions of approaches, and a discussion of results. We anticipate that your project will change somewhat over time; these changes and the reasons for them should be documented! **You will write one report document per group, and be sure to include all group member names in the document.**

Your report should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

## Motivation
Provide an overview of the project goals and motivation.

Squirrels are familiar neighbors to all New Yorkers. Central Park provides over 800 acres of prime habitat for approximately 2,300 squirrels (roughly 2.74 squirrels per acre)1. Given the high prevalence of squirrels in New York City and their versatile role as friends, pests, vectors for diseases, such as rabies, and snacks to local predators, we aim to describe behavioral trends and spatial distribution of squirrel sightings in Central Park using 2018 Squirrel Census data.

## Initial questions
  * What questions are you trying to answer? 
  * How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? 
  * What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
* Data: Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.

## Exploratory analysis
  * Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. 
  * Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.
  
## Additional analysis
If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail

## Discussion
  * What were your findings? 
  * Are they what you expect? 
  * What insights into the data can you make?


As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, **make sure that your report is a standalone document that fully describes your process and results.**

We also expect you to write high-quality code that is understandable to an outside reader. Coding collaboratively and actively reviewing code within the team will help with this!
