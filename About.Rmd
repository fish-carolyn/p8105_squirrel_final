### A Little About Our Data

The data from this project was collected from the [The Squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/), ran by the Department of Data - NYC, and available for download at [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw). The Squirrel Census is a multimedia science, design, art, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). The aims of this project is to count squirrels and and present their findings to the public in the form of "comprehensive maps, data visualizations, 45-RPM records, anthropomorphic storytelling, live presentations, semi-true videos, and other fun stuff". We love and embrace their mission of serving as a liason for the *believe* and *make-believe*.
