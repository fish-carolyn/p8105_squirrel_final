tables and whatever about "where the squirrels live"

#### Here is a map of squirrel location based on primary fur color. 

```{r squirrel_fur_plot_test}
squirrel_fur_graph =
  squirrel_census |> 
  select(unique_squirrel_id, x, y, primary_fur_color) |>
  filter(!is.na(primary_fur_color))
  plot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", color = ~primary_fur_color)
```
