<p>The written report produced by your team is central to this project.
This will detail how you completed your project, and should cover data
collection and cleaning, exploratory analyses, alternative strategies,
descriptions of approaches, and a discussion of results. We anticipate
that your project will change somewhat over time; these changes and the
reasons for them should be documented! <strong>You will write one report
document per group, and be sure to include all group member names in the
document.</strong></p>
<p><br><br> <br><br></p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The motivation behind our project is to perform a comprehensive
analysis on the squirrels of Central Park in New York City. Squirrels
are familiar neighbors to all New Yorkers, and Central Park provides
over 800 acres of prime habitat for approximately 2,300 squirrels
(roughly 2.74 squirrels per acre)<sup>1</sup>. Given the high prevalence
of squirrels in New York City and their versatile role as friends,
pests, vectors for diseases, such as rabies, and snacks to local
predators, we aim to describe behavioral patterns and spatial
distribution of squirrel sightings in Central Park.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related work</h3>
<p>We were inspired to perform this analysis after discovering 2018
squirrel data from <a href="https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/">The NYC
Squirrel Census</a>. The Squirrel Census is “a multimedia science,
design, and storytelling project,” and their 2018 data set can be found
on <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw">NYC
OpenData</a>. Since the data set contains the latitude and longitude of
each squirrel sighting, as well as several variables related to squirrel
activity, we thought it would provide a great opportunity to explore the
visualization and interactivity topics discussed in class.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial questions</h3>
<p>Our initial questions focused on discovering trends in demographic,
activity, or other behaviors of Central Park Squirrels. We were
interested in the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Are certain fur colors more prevalent than others in different
areas of the park?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there relationships between the sounds that squirrels make
and the activities they are engaged in?</p></li>
<li><p>Are certain types of squirrels more likely to engage with
humans?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After exploratory analysis and better understanding the strengths
(large sample) and limitations (few obvious spacial trends, short
observation period) of our data, we adjusted our questions to be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Are squirrels demographically similar throughout the
park?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there an observable trend between squirrel’s age or and their
primary fur color?</p></li>
<li><p>Are squirrels observed using different areas of the park for
different activities?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the frequency of squirrels observed in trees (above ground)
or on the ground differ by time of day (AM versus PM)? Does this
relationship exist after adjusting for various activities?</p></li>
<li><p>What sounds do squirrels make and how does this differ by their
activity or maturity?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Our data was downloaded from the Squirrel Census <a
href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-29">github</a>.
as a .csv file. The Squirrel Census relies on field observations so
despite the data appearing quite “clean” upon download from the source
github, we utilized some standard data cleaning checks to ensure the
data was clean and ready to be used for our analysis.</p>
<p>The data was cleaned using RStudio/RMarkdown to meet the following
criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every squirrel (observation) required a unique identifier
(<code>unique_squirrel_id</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Every squirrel had complete location/ geo data
(<code>hectare</code>, <code>x</code> (latitude), and <code>y</code>
(longitude)).</p></li>
<li><p>Every squirrel required non-missing data for <code>age</code>,
<code>primary</code> fur color, <code>location</code>,
<code>activity</code>, and <code>date</code> observed.</p></li>
<li><p>All continuous variables were numeric and stored as
such.</p></li>
<li><p>Dates must be saved in date format.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The source data set contained 3,023 observations and 31 variables.
After the removal of observations with missing data, the “clean” data
set used for site analyses had 2,824 observations and 36 variables.
Variables for <code>day</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>year</code>,
<code>date_assembled</code>, and <code>name</code> were added to the
final data set after some manipulation was done to adjust the date
variable. The name variable was created by randomly assigning squirrels
names from an R generated list of first and last squirrel names. The
<code>unique_squirrel_id</code> variable is a character variable of 11
values and characters, so it could be a mouthful when trying to consider
individual observations. We also believe each squirrel deserves a fun
name. The data used was collected between 2018-10-06 and 2018-10-20.</p>
<p>The final data used for analysis, saved <a
href="https://github.com/fish-carolyn/p8105_squirrel_final.git">here</a>,
contains the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x</code>: Longitude.</li>
<li><code>y</code>: Latitude.</li>
<li><code>unique_squirrel_id</code>: Identification tag for each
squirrel sightings. The tag is comprised of “Hectare ID” + “Shift” +
“Date” + “Hectare Squirrel Number.”</li>
<li><code>hectare</code>: ID tag, which is derived from the hectare grid
used to divide and count the park area. One axis that runs predominantly
north-to-south is numerical (1-42), and the axis that runs predominantly
east-to-west is roman characters (A-I).</li>
<li><code>shift</code>: Value is either “AM” or “PM,” to communicate
whether or not the sighting session occurred in the morning or late
afternoon.</li>
<li><code>date</code>: Concatenation of the sighting session day and
month.</li>
<li><code>hectare_squirrel_number</code>: Number within the
chronological sequence of squirrel sightings for a discrete sighting
session.</li>
<li><code>age</code>: Value is either “Adult” or “Juvenile.”</li>
<li><code>primary_fur_color</code>: Value is either “Gray,” “Cinnamon”
or “Black.”</li>
<li><code>highlight_fur_color</code>: Discrete value or string values
comprised of “Gray,” “Cinnamon” or “Black.”</li>
<li><code>combination_of_primary_and_highlight_color</code>: A
combination of the previous two columns; this column gives the total
permutations of primary and highlight colors observed.</li>
<li><code>color_notes</code>: Sighters occasionally added commentary on
the squirrel fur conditions. These notes are provided here.</li>
<li><code>location</code>: Value is either “Ground Plane” or “Above
Ground.” Sighters were instructed to indicate the location of where the
squirrel was when first sighted.</li>
<li><code>above_ground_sighter_measurement</code>: For squirrel
sightings on the ground plane, fields were populated with a value of
“FALSE.”</li>
<li><code>specific_location</code>: Sighters occasionally added
commentary on the squirrel location. These notes are provided here.</li>
<li><code>running</code>: Squirrel was seen running.</li>
<li><code>chasing</code>: Squirrel was seen chasing.</li>
<li><code>climbing</code>: Squirrel was seen climbing.</li>
<li><code>eating</code>: Squirrel was seen eating.</li>
<li><code>foraging</code>: Squirrel was seen foraging.</li>
<li><code>other_activites</code>: Other activities.</li>
<li><code>kuks</code>: Squirrel was heard kukking, a chirpy vocal
communication used for a variety of reasons.</li>
<li><code>quaas</code>: Squirrel was heard quaaing, an elongated vocal
communication which can indicate the presence of a ground predator such
as a dog.</li>
<li><code>moans</code>: Squirrel was heard moaning, a high-pitched vocal
communication which can indicate the presence of an air predator such as
a hawk.</li>
<li><code>tail_flags</code>: Squirrel was seen flagging its tail.
Flagging is a whipping motion used to exaggerate squirrel’s size and
confuse rivals or predators. Looks as if the squirrel is scribbling with
tail into the air.</li>

<h3>Exploratory analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical
analyses.</li>
<li>Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your
ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our exploratory analysis is segmented into three distinct areas of
focus: Squirreling the Stats (<a
href="descriptives.html">demographic</a>), Nesting Nooks (<a
href="activity.html">activity</a>), and Scurrying Secrets (<a
href="communication.html">communication</a>).</p>
<p>In the Demographic section, we looked at the distribution of ages and
fur color of squirrels in Central Park. Using plots of the distribution
of juvenile and adult squirrels throughout Central Park, there were
almost 8 times the number of adults to juveniles observed. Both adults
and juveniles were scattered throughout the park, but the juvenile
squirrels tended to cluster and were seen quite close to each other,
which may be indicative of squirrel nests in the area. Looking at the
distribution of squirrel fur color, the majority of Central Park’s
squirrels are gray (~80%), while few cinnamon (16%) and black (4%)
squirrels were observed. When comparing the distribution of primary fur
color by age, we saw that these fur color trends were consistent between
adults and juveniles.</p>
<p>When creating the Nesting Nooks page, we thought about different
aspects of the data that would be interesting to explore spatially.
Originally, maps of primary fur color and age were on the Nesting Nooks
page, but eventually we pivoted the page to be more about activity,
moving those maps to the demographics page. We were hoping to see more
spatial clustering of certain activities, but when mapped the data
points were randomly distributed around Central Park. Activities, such
as eating, chasing, climbing, and running were observed throughout the
park. Using density plots, we observed a modest cluster of increased
density for foraging in the center of the park, near The Lake. Next, we
looked into the frequency and distribution of squirrels observed on the
ground compared to above ground plane (in a tree, on a building, etc.),
but saw no spatial trends.</p>
<p>In our final exploratory analysis of communication and vocalizations,
we wanted to see if there were any trends in the sounds made by
squirrels (kuks, quaas, or moans) and the activities they were engaged
in when making sound (climbing, chasing, foraging, eating, running).
Using several plots and graphs, we discovered that there were no obvious
relationships between the sounds that squirrels make and their
interactions with humans or engagement in the aforementioned activities,
but in every case “kuks” were the most common sound and moans are fairly
rare. Finally we looked into the relationship between age and
vocalizations. The observed trends in vocalizations did not vary between
adults and juveniles; squirrels “kuk” most often.</p>
<p>In summary, after performing exploratory analyses, primarily in the
form of visualizations, there did not appear to be as much spatial or
physical variation in Central Park squirrels as we had initially
thought. Our analysis suggests the vast majority of squirrels in Central
Park are adults with gray fur, and they appear to engage in all
activities in all areas of the park. Most squirrels do not engage with
humans, and they make the same sounds regardless of the activity they
are engaged in or age. As a result, we decided to focus our project less
on the difference between different groups of squirrels and more on
providing descriptive visualizations, particularly in the form of maps,
with interactivity features for readers to generally learn more about
each squirrel, who they are, and what they do.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</div>
<div id="additional-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Additional analysis</h3>
<p>Despite finding that Central Park squirrels do not display a lot of
variation, we wanted to perform some statistical analyses to explore
trends in squirrel activity more deeply. We were puzzled with what
direction any statistical analysis should take due to the categorical
nature of this data. The lack of continuous variables limited our
options for analysis, so we opted to investigate relationships by using
a Chi Square Analysis and a Logistic Regression. The Chi Square Analysis
we conducted was a formal hypothesis test exploring the relationship
between the <code>shift</code> and <code>location</code> variables.
After tidying a subset of the data, we formed a contingency table and
ran a chi square test. The goal of our logistic regression analysis was
to investigate if we could predict the likelihood of a squirrel being
observed on the “ground plane,” based on time of squirrel sighting
(<code>shift</code>) and the following behavioral variables:
<code>running</code>, <code>chasing</code>, <code>climbing</code>,
<code>eatin</code>g and foraging. We created a binomial model, tidied
the output to include the p-value, estimate, and odds ratios. We also
did some residual plotting and visualizations to detect outliers and
ensure our model was appropriate for the data.</p>
<p>From the Chi-Square Test, we rejected the null hypothesis and found
at the 5% level of significance, there is evidence to suggest there is a
significant association between the time of day and the location where
squirrels are observed. From our research, squirrels exhibit different
location preferences or behaviors during the morning (AM) compared to
the afternoon (PM). Squirrels are known to be diurnal animals, so the
results of the chi-square test serves as additional evidence. Since
squirrels have been observed to be active more during dawn and dusk,
this aligns with the <a
href="https://www.esf.edu/aec/adks/mammals/gray_squirrel.php">literature</a>
on this topic. From the logistic regression, we found that the
<code>shift</code>, <code>running</code>, <code>climbing</code>,
<code>eating</code>, and <code>foraging</code> predictors in our model
were statistically significant at the 5% level. A squirrel spotted on
the ground plane is most likely to be seen running, climbing, eating, or
foraging. The effect of chasing was not statistically significant at the
0.05 level. Squirrels spotted on the ground plane also have a likelihood
to be spotted at night. The QQ plot showed the distribution of our model
to be approximately normal. The predicted values plotted against
residuals along with the violin plot showed evidence of skew for both
the above ground and ground plane plots. For optimization purposes,
before running a formal analysis this indicates to us we should check
for collinearity and run some additional diagnostic tests to see if we
can create a better model.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>What were your findings?</li>
<li>Are they what you expect?</li>
<li>What insights into the data can you make?</li>
</ul>
<p>As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail,
<strong>make sure that your report is a standalone document that fully
describes your process and results.</strong></p>
<p>Overall, we found that squirrels are relatively similar throughout
the park, both demographically and in terms of behavior. There are no
observable trends between squirrel ages and primary fur colors, and
squirrels are observed engaging in all activities in all areas of the
park. Squirrels also make the same sounds regardless of maturity,
activity, or interaction with humans.</p>
<p>From our statistical analyses, we found that there is a significant
association between the time of day and the location where squirrels are
observed. Squirrels are more likely to be observed on the ground plane
during the PM shift (OR: 1.50, p-value: 0.0003), adjusting for the
activity they were observed doing.</p>
<p>Our project also features an interactive map created with Shiny to
enable viewers to explore the spatial distribution of squirrels with
various combinations of attributes. The map includes landmarks and
streets of Central Park so that specific locations can be recognized.
Although there does not appear to be many obvious trends from our
analysis of Central Park squirrels, a goal of our project is for viewers
to be able to make their own insights and discoveries based on
recognizable locations of the park. We hope that viewers will be able to
walk away with more awareness and perhaps a newfound appreciation of the
nearby squirrels during their next visit to Central Park.</p>
